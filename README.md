Backup Wordpress Site and Database to Linux Server &amp; Send Copy To Amazon S3

This shell script will backup your entire Wordpress website as well as your database, save it on your server, and port a copy over to your Amazon S3 account.

Credit goes to XMODULO for this script. I've tested it on my sites as well as my clients' sites, and it works flawlessly.
