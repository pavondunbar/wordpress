Backup Wordpress Site and Database to Linux Server & Send Copy To Amazon S3 or DropBox

This shell script will backup your entire Wordpress website as well as your database and save it on your server. There si also a shell script to backup your Wordpress site and database and port a copy over to Amazon S3 or Dropbox.

It is advisable to set a cronjob to automatically run the script.

Credit goes to XMODULO for this script. I've tested it on my sites as well as my clients' sites, and it works flawlessly.
